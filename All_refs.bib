Hence, the population is most likely to escape extinction through 
adaptation if genetic variance is large (R and r2 p large), selection is weak (x2 and Vk large), and fecundity is high (k* large).

Bradshaw and 
McNeilly (1991) were skeptical that selection will often 
succeed in rescuing stressed populations from extinction. 
They drew on their extensive experience with heavy-metal 
tolerance in plants to point out that tolerance readily 
evolves in a minority of species, but seldom, if ever, in 
most.

Hoffmann and Parsons15: They hypothesize that the 
selective response involves a gen- 
eral stress-resistance mechanism 
fallowing increased heat and cold 
tolerance) coupled with a lower 
metabolic rate. They suggest that 
this may be a general feature of 
physiological adaptation to climatic 
stress (see also Ref. 16).

Some authors10,20,21 have argued that many 
species are depauperate for genetic 
variation related to distribution and 
abundance - a condition termed 
genostasis by Bradshaw21

Parsons4 has argued that additive variance 
for characters related to fitness in- 
creases in stressful environments, 
because fitness differences among 
genotypes are accentuated in 
stressful circumstances; however, in 
some cases heritabilities are re- 
duced in suboptimal conditions23. 

A number ofexperiments show that genetic 
covariances among traits change 
as a function of temperature27.

While these mechanisms

change, microevolution (genetic response to consistent 
selection on heritable traits; Falconer {\&}amp; Mackay 1996; 
Roff 1997; Lynch {\&}amp; Walsh 1998) is thought to be essential

There are several summaries of standard estimation procedures for genetic variances and covariances (17, 75), and of recent developments, emphasizing likelihood and resampling techniques (l07, 170, 214). Sampling errors tend to be extremely large: very large samples are needed to give a good chance of detecting low heritabilities, and the necessary sample size must be roughly quadrupled to detect between-population heritability differences of comparable magnitude (I27 , 128).

Tantawy et al (229) found that for both D. melanogaster and D. simulans, the phenotypic coefficient of variation for wing length was highest at extreme temperatures, whereas heritability was highest at an intermediate temperature. 

Genetic variances and covariances cannot be expected a priori to reveal long-term genetic potential or constraints any more than the linear terms of a Taylor's series can serve as an accurate guide to the global behavior of a nonlinear function. 

Seen thus, patterns of genetic variation are unlikely to impose strong constraints on evolution of mean phenotypes. However, the "adaptive landscape" can mislead (192). When very many characters are involved, direc{\-} tions of possible evolutionary change may be limited, even though one observes heritable variation for most arbitrarily chosen character com{\-}binations.

Houle (1992) proposed that proportional differences 
in the ability of traits to evolve (termed evolvability) 
could be represented by the coefficient of additive ge- 
netic variance, CVA, so that differences between pop- 
ulations or traits would not be a consequence of the 
environmental or nonadditive genetic variances. 
Another measure of evolvability is the additive genetic variance scaled by the square of the trait mean, IA, (Hansen et al. 2003), which measures the proportional response to directional selection when a particular unit of selection strength is applied to a trait.

using divergence to interpret constraint on G possible, but you do confound drift, selection (Phillips et al 2001) and divergence due to drift is expected to be proportional to genetic variance (Lande 1979)}
